# PyNNalign
PyTorch implementation of NNAlign from the base source code in C to Python.

Secondary structure features were extracted from peptides' source proteins using NetSurfP 3.0
Cellular sublocalizations were extracted from peptides source proteins using DeepLoc 2.0

Used to implement secondary structure features for the paper:
